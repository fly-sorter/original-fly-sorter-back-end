# Build Status
# Description
- An inventory management application for the Seattle-based company Fly-Sorter. Fly Sorter builds
machines to sort fruit flies so they can be used for scientific research. This application keeps track of those machine assemblies, sub-assemblies, and the parts that belong to those
sub assemblies. These components are displayed on the page and allows the user to click
on a sub-assembly to reveal the parts that makeup that sub-assembly.
The table also allows the user to filter parts and search for a part in order to make finding particular parts faster and easier for the user.
